================================================================================

REQUIREMENTS:
  ✓ Flutter SDK 3.3.0+
  ✓ Firebase CLI
  ✓ Node.js (for Firebase)
  ✓ Git (for version control)

QUICK START (LOCAL MACHINE):

1. Clone the repository:
   $ git clone https://github.com/Jerronce/Farad-App.git
   $ cd Farad-App

2. Install dependencies:
   $ flutter pub get

3. Build for web:
   $ flutter build web --release

4. Deploy to Firebase:
   $ firebase login
   $ firebase deploy

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:
  See BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md in the repository

================================================================================
                        TESTING CHECKLIST
================================================================================

BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
  □ Test Firebase connection
  □ Verify authentication flows (sign-up, login, logout)
  □ Test driver registration and truck listing
  □ Test customer order placement
  □ Test payment flow with Flutterwave
  □ Verify real-time updates (Firestore sync)
  □ Test UI on mobile and desktop
  □ Verify error handling
  □ Check loading states
  □ Test with real Flutterwave account (if going live)

================================================================================
                        NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. LOCAL SETUP (Your Machine):
   ✓ Clone the latest code from GitHub
   ✓ Run: flutter pub get
   ✓ Run: flutter build web --release
   ✓ Test locally: flutter run -d chrome

2. FIREBASE SETUP:
   ✓ Create Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com
   ✓ Update firebase.json with your project ID
   ✓ Set up Firestore security rules
   ✓ Enable Firebase Authentication
   ✓ Configure Firebase Hosting

3. FLUTTERWAVE SETUP:
   ✓ Create Flutterwave account (if not done)
   ✓ Get your public and secret keys
   ✓ Update the public key in flutterwave_service.dart
   ✓ Set up webhook (optional but recommended)

4. DEPLOYMENT:
   ✓ Login to Firebase CLI: firebase login
   ✓ Build web app: flutter build web --release
   ✓ Deploy: firebase deploy
   ✓ Get live URL from Firebase console

5. GO LIVE:
   ✓ Announce your app
   ✓ Monitor Firebase analytics
   ✓ Track Flutterwave transactions
   ✓ Collect user feedback
   ✓ Iterate and improve

================================================================================
                        FIREBASE LIVE URL
================================================================================

After deployment, your app will be available at:
  https://<your-firebase-project>.web.app

Example:
  https://farad-5bc01.web.app

To find your URL:
  1. Go to Firebase Console
  2. Select your project
  3. Click Hosting
  4. Copy your domain URL

================================================================================
                        IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. FLUTTERWAVE KEY:
   The public key is currently set to a test key. For production, update it
   with your own Flutterwave account key in:
   → lib/services/flutterwave_service.dart

2. FIREBASE RULES:
   Set up proper Firestore security rules in Firebase Console before going live:
   → Control who can read/write to trucks and orders collections

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   Consider moving sensitive config to environment files:
   → Use flutter_dotenv package for managing secrets

4. MONITORING:
   Set up Firebase Analytics and Cloud Logging for production monitoring

5. ERROR TRACKING:
   Consider integrating Sentry or similar for error reporting
